# Techin-510-LAB2
# Penguin Explorer

A data analysis application to find out interesting insights about penguins in the Artic.

## Get started
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

streamlit run app.py
```

## Lessons Learned
- **Filtering Data**: Users can filter the penguin data based on the range of bill lengths using a slider, select specific species using a dropdown menu, and choose one or more islands using a multiselect dropdown.
- **Data Visualization**: The application visualizes the filtered penguin data using Plotly charts, including scatter plots and histograms, providing interactive visualizations for better understanding the data.

## Questions
- In the actual development of UI interfaces and interactions, is it necessary to use a platform such as streamlit? For example, if I want to design some UI components and user interactions that are not available in streamlit, how do I need to do it?

## TODO
1. Link to your Streamlit cloud web app for data analysis and visualization
2. A GitHub repo link
    1. README.md
    2. app.py
