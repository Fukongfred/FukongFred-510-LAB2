# Penguin Explorer

A data analysis application to find out interesting insights about penguins in the Artic.

## Get started
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Lessons Learned
- **Filtering Data**: Users can filter the penguin data based on the range of bill lengths using a slider, select specific species using a dropdown menu, and choose one or more islands using a multiselect dropdown.
- **Data Visualization**: The application visualizes the filtered penguin data using Plotly charts, including scatter plots and histograms, providing interactive visualizations for better understanding the data.

## Questions
- How to build a top bar that can be selected and the interface will navigate to the contents u selected?

## TODO
1. Link to your Streamlit cloud web app for data analysis and visualization
2. A GitHub repo link
